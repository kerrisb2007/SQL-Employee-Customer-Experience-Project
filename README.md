# SQL-Employee-Customer-Experience-Project

This project explores two weeks of employee and customer experience data for a newly established pizza brand to understand how the brand is performing. SQLite was used to create metrics and queries that answer the following questions: 

1.    How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01).
2.    What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pick up the order?
3.    What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
4.    What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
5.    What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

The data from this project can be obtained via https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/
